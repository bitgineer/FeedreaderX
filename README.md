Sure, here are the step-by-step installation instructions for the RSS reader project:

2. Clone the repository using `git clone` command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bitgineer/FeedreaderX.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the `FeedreaderX` directory:

   ```
   cd FeedreaderX
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install feedparser discord.py
   ```

5. Open the `FeedreaderX.py` file in a text editor and replace the following variables with your own values:

   - `RSS_FEED_URL`: The URL of the RSS feed you want to monitor.
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: The URL of the Discord webhook you want to use to send updates.

6. Save the `FeedreaderX.py` file.

7. Run the `FeedreaderX.py` script using Python:

   The script will start monitoring the RSS feed and sending updates to the Discord webhook.

That's it! You now have the RSS reader up and running on your system. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the project's README file or open an issue on the GitHub repository page.
